# Project

The project consists of creating a simple e-commerce website that allows the user to select a product and its quantity before proceeding to the payment gateway.

## Background

With this exercise I have been able to reinforce my knowledge of front-end (HTML5 / CSS3 / SASS / MIXINS / BEM), ReactJS, Redux Toolkit and the use of external APIs.

:Framework of CSS to facilitate the use of CSS3 and make it more practical. Also, use of **mixins** and **variables** in order to improve the code and make it more efficient. Flex was used to design parts of the layout and react bootstrap to build e. g. the hero.

:Compilation system to automate repetitive workflows and compose them into efficient build pipelines.

:Version control.

## API

Two third-party APIs have been used for this project:

1. External API to fetch products from the website. => (https://fakestoreapi.com/products)
2. External API to render the list of countries in the "select" field of the payment form. => (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)

## Installation

**NOTE:** [Node JS] (https://nodejs.org/) is required to work with this Starter Kit:

_Steps to follow to start a project from scratch: _

1. **Clone this repository from GitHub**.
1. **Open a terminal** in the root folder of the repository.
1. **Install the local dependencies** by executing the command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

**Steps to start the project:**

Once all the dependencies are installed, the project can be started. **to start the project** run the command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command:

- **Open a window of your browser and show the web page** (http: // localhost: 3000 / # /).
- It also processes the **HTML, SASS / CSS and JS files and** generates and saves them in the `public /` folder. For instance:
  - Convert SASS files into CSS.

If you want to edit this project after executing `npm start` you can start editing all the files that are inside the`src /`folder and programming comfortably.

**To generate my page for production run the command:**

```bash
npm run githubpages
```

A shortcut that generates the production version and pushes the `docs /` folder at once. We recommend looking at the `package.json` file to learn how it works.

Also instead of cloning the repository, you can conveniently download it to your local server for review.
